# 📦 recovery-vault

This repository is a public, encrypted, multi-layered recovery system for all critical personal accounts, credentials, and cryptographic materials.

- 💀 Everything inside is encrypted. Brutally.
- 🧠 Designed to be human-recoverable (by me) from memory alone.
- ☢️ Contains recovery codes, fallback credentials, and nuclear options.
- 🪦 If I disappear and you're not me: this won't help you. Go touch grass.

### ❗️Disclaimer

This repository is intentionally public. The contents are mathematically unreachable without the correct passphrases. You're welcome to stare at the entropy and weep.
